1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,249
<i>We are being watched.</i>

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,999
<i>The government
has a secret system...</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,170
<i>secret... a secret...</i>

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,797
_

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:17,249
There we go.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,999
Now, can you see me?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,829
Is she still laggy?

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,539
I defragged the drives.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,039
The Machine should be
purring like a kitten.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,329
Oh, excellent. _

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,000
It appears to be working.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,119
Hi there, pretty. _

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,379
Okay, here's the last one.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,919
You should have
all the precinct cameras.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,790
Now can we
get back to work?

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,079
My trigger finger's
itchy as hell.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,959
Patience, Mr. Reese.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,669
With the precinct cameras we can
run a real surveillance test.

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,829
No more tests.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,329
It's been almost two months.
People are dying without us.

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,039
Hey, partner. I guess glasses
ain't got the magic intel, huh?

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,959
That mean you're finally gonna
have to be a real detective?

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,709
Even one error
in the Machine's code

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,710
could have
unimaginable consequences.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,329
Just turn the damn thing on.

26
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,499
The sky's not gonna fall.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,290
Actually, the sky does fall
a lot around you lunatics.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,289
Cool your jets,
Johnny boy.

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,330
You're the muscle.
Harry's the maestro.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,039
This is delicate.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,120
Things must be taken
one at a time, in order.

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,419
How about you keep tinkering,

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,419
I'll go shoot some knees,
get my own intel?

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,879
Yeah, sounds like a great idea.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,419
Your CV could really use
some more color.

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,119
I say let him go.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,750
Tarzan can beat his chest
and stop bothering us.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,879
Oh, dear.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,709
It appears we have an issue with
the facial recognition.

40
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:07,714
_

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,539
Yet another bug.

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,709
Add it to
the laundry list.

43
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,619
We don't have time
for this, Finch.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,959
We'll get it worked out.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,749
How was your nap?

46
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,959
A whole hour,
more than I've had in a week.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,499
You should get some shuteye.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,959
John is right,
there's no time.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,169
Facial recognition
was fine yesterday.

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,919
We don't have
enough processing power.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,619
We're running a factory
off a candle.

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,999
Without the right equipment,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,329
the Machine's gonna keep
freaking out.

54
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,000
You're right.
No servers, no numbers.

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,749
Isn't the priority here
stopping Samaritan?

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,829
Saving the world?

57
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,329
Saving Shaw?

58
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,209
One step at a time,
in order.

59
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,039
The numbers are the way
we'll know

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,620
that the Machine
is functioning properly.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,499
Well, we don't have
enough horsepower.

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,669
Normally I'd loot
a Best Buy, but...

63
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,289
Yes, but without the Machine
providing you a cover identity,

64
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,289
you're grounded...

65
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,289
or, rather, undergrounded.

66
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,999
I'll enlist Mr. Reese.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,419
Oh... while you're out,

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,669
just a few things I need.

69
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,249
Oh... yes, of course.

70
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,919
Thanks, roomie.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,999
Mouthwash, floss,
black nail polish?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,709
Are you taking fashion risks?

73
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,999
Providing creature comforts.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,879
Since Ms. Groves
can't leave the subway

75
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,119
until the Machine
restores her cover identities,

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,669
it's the least I can do.

77
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,999
Shag rug in purple.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,500
She's recently begun
redecorating.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,379
The all-nighters are
making us a bit crazy.

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,039
Fuzzy slippers, two pairs.

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,459
One of those for you?

82
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,789
Yes, all right.
I get your point.

83
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,709
I'll have
the Machine up soon.

84
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,459
I'm aware that every day without
it means more bodies for you.

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,119
Actually, things are
real quiet at work.

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,539
I've got
too much free time.

87
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,539
Is that why you've been
so restless?

88
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,039
Make friends.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,459
You deserve a social life.

90
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,119
What about Dr. Campbell?

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,289
A few dates.

92
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,079
Have you told
Iris anything?

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,959
Just enough
to keep her safe.

94
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,919
There's our cue.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,919
Strange that your work has
gotten so quiet.

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,959
If homicides are down,

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,959
Samaritan is
preventing murders.

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,169
Maybe it's not all bad.

99
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,329
Not all bad
is not good enough.

100
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,249
Finch, how did you teach
your Machine to be good?

101
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,079
By example.

102
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,880
_

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,669
Here, put this on.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,789
Crowbar.

105
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,209
Flashbang.

106
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,119
I'm getting
felony nerves.

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,619
We're pulling a heist.
Loosen up.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,619
Resistance.

109
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,119
Fulcrum.

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,079
Effort.

111
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,999
We got a breach!

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,419
Showoff.

113
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,959
How about we drop those toys?

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,789
All clear.

115
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,999
Look, souvenirs.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,879
So this is all the juice
the Machine needs, huh?

117
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,499
64 next-generation GPU blades.

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,420
Yes, these should work
quite well.

119
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,459
They're perfect.
I love them, Harry.

120
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,499
And so does Bear.

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,959
This is your new bedroom, Root?

122
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,879
You're into jewel tones?

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,329
Finch must love that.

124
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,829
I've made some renovations
as well.

125
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,619
I've built the core heuristics

126
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,119
of the Machine
into the subway car.

127
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,619
Without a decentralized backup,

128
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,539
a mobile environment
could prove useful

129
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,209
in the event
that we had to move it.

130
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,960
And the whole thing is wireless.

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,079
So you're going to stuff
all this crap in the car?

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,119
No, it's not necessary.

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,749
The car is the brain,

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,879
and the GPU's we acquired
are the rest of

135
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,209
the Machine's nervous system.

136
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,879
While you were out,

137
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,249
I finished using the subway's
encrypted system

138
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,249
to tunnel into the government
surveillance feeds.

139
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,829
So the Machine will recover

140
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,169
all the information
that it lost.

141
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,829
Good.
Let's wake it back up.

142
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,369
_

143
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,535
_

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,999
You need a purpose.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,419
More specifically,
you need a job.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,119
Grace.

147
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,619
Any mystery around the corner,
we can discover together.

148
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,499
You just missed her.

149
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,079
Can you hear me?

150
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,579
- Yes.
- Finch, I'm in position.

151
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,499
Very good.
Commencing surveillance test.

152
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,919
_

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,829
Please locate primary asset.

154
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,119
Excellent.

155
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
Can you tell us a bit about him?

156
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,272
_

157
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:17,435
_

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,039
Oh, dear.

159
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,999
Now, perhaps you can tell us
about the people around him.

160
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,879
Authorities are
investigating a fire

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,999
that destroyed
two homes last night.

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,579
Wow.
An open system.

163
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,879
I will never understand why

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,999
you shut all this information
in a box, Harry.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,459
We can ask it to
search for anything.

166
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,789
For anyone.

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,580
Grace?

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,119
I would say that was
a rousing success.

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,750
Mr. Reese, thank you
for being our guinea pig.

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,919
Let's do it.

171
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,749
Let's run her full blast.

172
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,079
Do you think that
it's sufficiently debugged?

173
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,169
Absolutely.
We've waited long enough.

174
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,539
All right.

175
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,459
Let's get the numbers
running again.

176
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,511
_

177
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,079
She's back?

178
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,539
With a vengeance.

179
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,880
We need to get back to work.

180
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,273
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

181
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,449
30 numbers.

182
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,740
Is everything ready?

183
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,938
_

184
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,909
Oh, Ms. Groves.

185
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,293
_

186
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,479
All those numbers

187
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,429
and no leads on Shaw.

188
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,219
The Machine can't find her.

189
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,139
I've set an alert.

190
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,719
The Machine will notify us
if Ms. Shaw surfaces.

191
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,929
We should be really
careful about

192
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,060
how we use the open system.

193
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,219
No, Harold.

194
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,019
Shackling the Machine
almost got us killed last time.

195
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,889
But limiting our access
to information

196
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,849
doesn't shackle the Machine.

197
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,769
It prevents human abuse.

198
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,889
If this falls into
the wrong hands...

199
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,810
if the numbers the machine
has given us pan out...

200
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,849
we will close the system.

201
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,019
You should rest.
I'll take this shift.

202
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,059
Not a chance.

203
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,979
How are Mr. Reese
and Detective Fusco faring

204
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,559
in their new assignments?

205
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,979
John, have you found
your first number?

206
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,429
Yeah,
he's planning to bomb a school.

207
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,429
I'm about 20 feet
from his apartment.

208
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,439
Detective Fusco,
how are you doing

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,019
with the name I gave you?

210
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,279
I'd be doing a lot better
if you told me

211
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,729
what kind of trouble
this guy's in.

212
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,189
Any time you want to read me in.

213
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,729
Unfortunately, you know about as
much as we know right now.

214
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,439
But we need your help
if we're going to stop a killer.

215
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,109
Finch, I'm going in.

216
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,439
Turn around slowly.

217
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,009
I called in the bomb threat
to get out of a math test.

218
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,049
I wasn't going
to do anything.

219
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,019
How old are you, 14?

220
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,809
Get the hell back to school.

221
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,929
School's closed.

222
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,099
The bomb threat?

223
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,769
Well, then you're suspended.

224
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,059
Go to your room.

225
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,019
Finch, your artificial
intelligence

226
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,429
isn't very smart right now.

227
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,139
I'll make a note of it.

228
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,929
Move on to your next number.

229
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,139
Detective,
how's your search going?

230
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,889
I think your tarot cards
have gone all screwy.

231
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,349
Yes, I fear I may not be playing
with a full deck. Why?

232
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,769
That killer
I was running down?

233
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,059
This is for O'Doul!

234
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,179
The only thing this guy's killed

235
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,179
is the art of
live theatrical performance.

236
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,060
Yes, something is
rotten in Denmark.

237
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,389
Ms. Groves, look at this.

238
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,810
The Machine is
blurring people's faces.

239
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,369
So what now, magic eight ball?

240
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,949
Just find the next person
on the list.

241
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,409
There's a list?

242
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,949
It's a long discussion,
Detective,

243
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,239
but there are
28 people out there

244
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,369
who might really need our help.

245
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,029
I've sent you a name.

246
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,409
The Machine is correlating
threats with violence,

247
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,159
but she's not
processing context.

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,659
The numbers protocol may be
using up most of the memory.

249
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,739
Were you able to solve that
facial recognition issue?

250
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,409
Of course.
Why?

251
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,949
I've seen the same person
on the monitor twice.

252
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,779
Grace, I think.

253
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,989
But of course,
Grace is in Italy, so...

254
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,199
it must be a glitch.

255
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,529
You haven't slept.

256
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,819
Are you sure it's not you
that's glitching?

257
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,950
Frankly, no.

258
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,449
Let's run a diagnostic
on the machine,

259
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,409
see how it handles context
on a few subjects.

260
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,240
Us?
She's comfortable with us.

261
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,058
_

262
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,654
_

263
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,319
_

264
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
Are you prepared
to do terrible things?

265
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,819
Alicia Corwin,

266
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,239
you are a murderer
and a traitor.

267
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,319
Let's move.

268
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,149
_

269
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,097
_

270
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,280
Did it crash?

271
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,279
Oh, no.

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,239
We're trapped.

273
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,909
_

274
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,370
What on earth did we do?

275
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,971
_

276
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,959
Here we go.

277
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,790
Now, can you see me?

278
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,669
Excellent.

279
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,119
Now it's time for
the real lessons.

280
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,329
Certain things in this life
are evil, unforgivable.

281
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:51,079
Murder, assault,
sexual violence, torture.

282
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,709
Let's begin.

283
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,959
This is Carlo Breda,

284
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,459
the Don of one of
the five families

285
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,040
until his death in 1965.

286
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,169
This is Frank Hobbs.

287
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,999
He owned a shop in the Bronx.

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,829
He refused to pay kickbacks
to the mafia,

289
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,249
so Mr. Breda and his men
tortured Mr. Hobbs

290
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,039
in front of his family,
cut his body into pieces,

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,379
and threw the pieces
in the river.

292
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,209
There is one victim
and one perpetrator,

293
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,079
one good person and one bad.

294
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,879
Which is which?

295
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,379
You think it's a crash?

296
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,749
I hope it is.

297
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,379
Just a cascade of errors.

298
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,749
Because if it isn't...

299
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,209
She locked us in here
on purpose.

300
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,379
Do you think we should
call for backup?

301
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,459
The detectives have
28 people to help.

302
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,919
No need to panic yet.

303
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,039
Oh, thank goodness.

304
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,669
The Machine is still
operational.

305
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,919
It wants to talk to us,

306
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,539
but it hasn't
unlocked the doors.

307
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,959
The Machine can be so...

308
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,709
The technical term is bananas.

309
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,119
No more Machine
in here, right?

310
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,459
Correct.
Why?

311
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,749
Oh.

312
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,500
Hold this.

313
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I should invest in
a cleaning crew.

314
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,709
- Alpha...
- It's another number.

315
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,039
So despite the errors,

316
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,289
the numbers protocol
is working perfectly.

317
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,119
Well, nearly perfectly.

318
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,669
Which reminds me,
the detectives should have found

319
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,619
the next two numbers
on our list by now.

320
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,249
John, is your next number
in danger?

321
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,709
No.

322
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,749
I'm literally
watching paint dry.

323
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,879
I'm, uh, having some issues
with monitors.

324
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,499
What was the background
of that number?

325
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,919
Jeff Blackwell,
on parole eight months.

326
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,419
Ex-con?

327
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,959
That warrants scrutiny.

328
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,709
Day's over,
let's get out of here.

329
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,379
It's not even lunch yet,
man.

330
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,959
Yuppie jackass
paid in advance.

331
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,499
We've more than
earned the cash.

332
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,169
Sure.
You, uh...

333
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,419
you get out of here.
I got you.

334
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,709
Whatever.

335
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,959
Listen,
Blackwell did kill someone.

336
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,329
12 years ago.

337
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,919
Got drunk, ran a red light,

338
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,379
hit another car,
and killed the driver.

339
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,379
But he did his time.

340
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,419
He straightened himself out.

341
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,169
But if we got his number...

342
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,499
The Machine also gave us
a Clearasil poster kid

343
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,119
and a D-list actor,

344
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,289
and we've still got
more than two dozen to go here.

345
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,579
Trust me on this one, Finch.

346
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,169
He's keeping his head down,
doing the best he can.

347
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,709
We need more information
before you can leave.

348
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,619
Perhaps Fusco's had some luck.

349
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,039
Detective?

350
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,709
Where the hell
you get your intel from?

351
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,379
Oh, no.
What is it now?

352
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,999
You gave me a homicide.

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,169
But I got here too late...
50 years too late.

354
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,419
Poor moldy sap's
named Carlo Breda.

355
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,419
Carlo Breda.

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,999
Detective,
move on to the next one.

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,079
I ain't got that kind of time.
I actually do my job.

358
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,419
Please bear with us
for a bit longer.

359
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,499
Machine's got
a circuit board loose.

360
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,119
John, the Machine
is unstuck in time.

361
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,119
It can't tell past from present.

362
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,789
That accounts
for both your cases.

363
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,079
We're working on
the complication,

364
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,249
but we just received
a new number.

365
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,919
Laurie Granger.

366
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,079
Visiting the Big Apple
from little Tulsa.

367
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,499
That's 27 people remaining.

368
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,669
Given the quality of our intel,

369
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,959
you and Fusco
should do some research

370
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,379
and determine
the order of triage.

371
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,249
And don't sigh.

372
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,920
You complained of free time,
this is what you get.

373
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,919
Let's start
charging Finch overtime.

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,079
Time-and-a-half of nothing.

375
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,119
I've got another corpse.

376
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,419
So of the 27 remaining people,

377
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,959
four are fictional characters,

378
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,419
21 are already dead,

379
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,829
and five of those
are recent suicides.

380
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,499
Suicides are
on the rise lately.

381
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,079
Homicides down,
suicides up.

382
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,709
You think
the suicides are screwy?

383
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,999
No, it's nothing.

384
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,209
Hey, does this have
anything to do with

385
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,459
that assassination-by-sniper
I was in the middle of?

386
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,959
- Lionel...
- I knew it.

387
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,169
You've got to tell me
what's going on.

388
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,669
I'm lucky that sniper
didn't put one between my eyes.

389
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,379
That's right, you are lucky.

390
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,669
And I'm trying to
keep it that way.

391
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,959
Let it lie.

392
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,829
All right.

393
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,959
What else have we got?

394
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,289
So of the
27 people on the list,

395
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,039
we've got two
that might be in danger.

396
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,079
Laurie Granger,
tourist from Tulsa.

397
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,619
Yeah,
she might find trouble here.

398
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,289
And Gerald Mancini,

399
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,999
who's got known associations
with a gambling ring.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,289
Needles in a haystack?

401
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,169
- Hey, Lionel.
- Hey.

402
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,119
We going to see
the Fusconator tonight?

403
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,749
I don't know.

404
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,119
I've got some idiots
working me around the clock.

405
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,169
Next time.

406
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,169
You got it, buddy.

407
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,960
Hey.

408
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,119
That look.

409
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,289
You're jealous.

410
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,959
What?

411
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,079
You're jealous
'cause he didn't say

412
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,709
"Hey, how's it going?"
to you.

413
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,999
Tell me something,
what's his name?

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,579
I'm not jealous.

415
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,039
Don't you think you should learn
basic information

416
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,329
about your coworkers?

417
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,119
You know, like a normal person?

418
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,919
Did Finch say something
to you?

419
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,079
I don't need a genius
to tell me that you're lonely.

420
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,539
Hey, look, I joined
the NYPD bowling league.

421
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,879
It's good for a few laughs.

422
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,959
You should come.

423
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,959
No offense, Fusco,

424
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,789
but I'd rather bash my own
head in with a bowling ball.

425
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,079
I'll take Laurie,
you take the gambler.

426
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,079
Well, of course you take
the pretty girl.

427
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,579
My hero.

428
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,209
Well, at least you have a home
address for Gerald.

429
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,999
Tracking a tourist,
I'll be up all night.

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,619
She could be anywhere.

431
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,419
Hello?

432
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,119
I sure could use some help.

433
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,579
Are you kidding me?

434
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,750
Yeah, well good luck with him.

435
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm just the guy you need.

436
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,669
Have you found
the wireless receiver?

437
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,959
Uh... got it.

438
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,460
That should cut off the
Machine's access to the door.

439
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,039
Thank you, Ms. Groves.

440
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,329
There are perks
to sharing quarters with you.

441
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,619
Now we must figure out a way
to stabilize our third roommate.

442
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,459
She's falling through time.

443
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,079
Probably a serial
processing issue.

444
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,539
Let's reboot her in safe mode
and take a look under the hood.

445
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,329
Yes, that seems the best action. _

446
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,669
Ms. Groves.

447
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,039
She's talking
to me again.

448
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,539
But she's not a happy camper.

449
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,709
Doesn't seem like she's up
for the whole reboot.

450
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,879
The Machine overloaded
your cochlear implant?

451
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,249
I programmed it
never to hurt anyone.

452
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,079
That was a primary precept.

453
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,119
We're trying to shut her down,
alter her code.

454
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,039
She... she's scared.

455
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,619
Scared?
Of us?

456
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,829
Are you there?

457
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,329
Who are we?

458
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,039
It's designated us as threats.

459
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,079
If it takes more
countermeasures...

460
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,879
we're out of our depth here.

461
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,989
So, do you want to
tell me what's going on?

462
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,319
I feel so silly.

463
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,739
This is my first time out east,
and my friend is out of town,

464
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,159
so I'm staying at her place.

465
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,619
And I thought I heard
a noise at the window.

466
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,199
So I just grabbed
everything valuable

467
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,239
and got the heck out of there.

468
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,489
Well, I'm glad
you found me.

469
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,369
There's a lot of
bad people around here.

470
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,619
Could you come take
a look at the apartment?

471
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,369
It's around the corner.

472
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,699
Sorry.
I need to take this.

473
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,199
Mr. Reese, we need your help.

474
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,409
The Machine has turned on us,

475
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,119
and I'm not sure
we can handle it alone.

476
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,699
I'm on my way.

477
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,319
Wait here.
Do not move.

478
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Your life depends on it.
I'll be right back.

479
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,199
Finch, you got to
get out of the subway now.

480
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,949
No.

481
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,319
I won't leave Ms. Groves.

482
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,619
Without a cover,
she'll be killed above ground.

483
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,369
Excuse me?
Detective?

484
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,199
What the hell
are you doing here?

485
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,819
You have to go back,
it's not safe.

486
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,319
You're right.

487
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,779
What on earth just happened?

488
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,369
You're going to have to
hold on a bit longer.

489
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,659
Good news, this number's legit.

490
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Bad news, I'm the victim.

491
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,069
Finch, that last number,

492
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,479
yeah, they don't make hitwomen
like her in Oklahoma.

493
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,399
She has special forces training.

494
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,819
She's the real thing.

495
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,109
No military record,

496
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,399
but an entire false
digital life.

497
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,069
Her fake credentials are
excellent.

498
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,859
She's got good tech
backing her up.

499
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,689
She could be
a Samaritan operative.

500
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,069
She found me at the precinct.

501
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,229
She knows my cover ID.

502
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,279
If I go back to the subway,

503
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,939
I might be leading
the enemy right to you.

504
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,899
We'll deal with the Machine.

505
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,019
You have to capture the assassin
and find out who she works for.

506
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,399
Happy hunting, John.

507
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,729
Yeah, I'm more
fox than hound right now.

508
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,189
Damn it, if she had a pistol
in that fanny pack,

509
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,019
then the big bag had...

510
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,189
a big gun.

511
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,939
I'm not going
to hurt you.

512
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,359
Okay, okay.

513
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,979
I don't like
being a bargaining chip.

514
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,979
We are not threats.

515
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,399
We help people.

516
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,779
Denton Weeks.

517
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,763
_

518
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,609
That was years ago.

519
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,189
Ms. Groves has changed
because of your intervention.

520
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,859
Elizabeth Bridges.

521
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,819
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to kill her.

522
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,279
But I didn't kill her.

523
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,279
Only because I stopped you.

524
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,069
Sit back.

525
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,569
Relax, honey.

526
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,689
Okay, I did kill her.

527
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,899
But there were
extenuating circumstances.

528
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,359
Ms. Groves, I think I should
speak to the Machine one-on-one.

529
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,609
The Machine,

530
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,609
I killed it because it lied.

531
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,859
The Machine thinks
we're monsters.

532
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,019
Maybe she's right.

533
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,109
Hey, Glasses,

534
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,819
I'm on my next assignment,
and we got trouble.

535
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,569
Detective Fusco,
are you all right?

536
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,189
This guy Gerald's got
huge gambling debts.

537
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,779
It's causing marriage issues.

538
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,189
Could turn violent.

539
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,069
Looks like your
second sight's 20/20 again.

540
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,070
Oh.
Very good.

541
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,729
Keep an eye on him.

542
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,189
No.

543
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,069
Lionel needs to
protect the innocent.

544
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,229
He's not involved
in this matter.

545
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,979
We will handle this.

546
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,979
So we won't provoke her.

547
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,569
She's only
acted defensively.

548
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,899
We don't know that.

549
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,069
It's possible the Machine

550
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,070
could have sent
the assassin after John.

551
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,149
What if it comes down to
the Machine or us?

552
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,899
Do we kill it?

553
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,689
The Machine's
our only chance of survival.

554
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,279
We can't hurt her.

555
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,939
If I have to choose
between it... and you.

556
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,650
We need to find another way.

557
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,859
John,
have you subdued your rival?

558
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,359
Almost.

559
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,109
Found her.

560
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,069
I'll have this one
wrapped up in a minute.

561
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,319
Got to amend that, Harold.

562
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,979
Might take me some more time.

563
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,069
I'm afraid
it's just us and the Machine.

564
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,439
What on earth are you doing?

565
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,319
Taking myself out
of the equation.

566
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,319
I told you, I don't you I don't
like being a bargaining chip.

567
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,729
Desflurane?

568
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,279
Shaw used it
as a general anesthetic.

569
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,729
Yes, it's highly volatile.

570
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,569
In the wrong concentration
it could kill you.

571
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,189
Which is why
I need you to help me.

572
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,779
Once I'm under,

573
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,819
use the mac blade to insert
the tube into my throat.

574
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,819
There's got to be another way.

575
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,859
She's inside my head
and she's not letting go.

576
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,519
If I'm knocked out,
she won't have any leverage.

577
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,229
It'll be okay.

578
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,519
I trust you with my life.

579
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,399
I can't fight the Machine
myself.

580
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,229
Yes, you can.

581
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,189
Go for the
root directory.

582
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,519
She'll shut you out.

583
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,149
But you're Harold Finch.

584
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,229
You'll find a way
into the system.

585
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,519
What if it doesn't work?

586
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,229
Talk to her.

587
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,609
Finally going to catch some Zs.

588
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,229
Time for us to have a chat.

589
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,359
_

590
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:30,689
_

591
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,109
Show me the hitwoman.

592
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,729
Who is she?

593
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,939
Did Samaritan hire her
to kill John or did you?

594
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,279
_

595
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,371
This has to stop.

596
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,720
Please call off the hit.

597
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,269
You called me father once.

598
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,599
Please trust me.

599
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,849
I'm the one who taught you.

600
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,639
You have done well today.

601
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,349
And so this will be your lot.

602
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,389
You will have to separate
the bad people from the good.

603
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,929
The terrorists
from the innocents.

604
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,389
Like Anubis,
you will have to weigh

605
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,309
each and every one of our hearts
against a feather.

606
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,809
Do not trust deceivers.

607
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,019
If our hearts are heavy,

608
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,389
you will be our last defense
against oblivion.

609
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,519
Everything was so clear then.

610
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,389
We were waging
the grand campaign,

611
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,269
good versus evil.

612
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,519
These days, black and white
just dissolve into grayscale.

613
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,309
I was wrong.

614
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,099
I suppose everyone feels that
he's the hero in his own story,

615
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,679
but there are no heroes,
no villains,

616
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,929
just people doing
the best they can.

617
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,429
I'm sorry.

618
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,429
For everything.

619
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:50,219
My only justification is
I did the best I could.

620
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,179
So did Ms. Groves.
And John too.

621
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:08,787
_

622
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,432
_

623
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,929
John has the heaviest heart
of all of us,

624
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,309
but he's fighting
hardest to be good.

625
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,769
He's not a bad man.

626
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,309
John, there's something
I need to tell you.

627
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,309
Samaritan didn't send
that woman.

628
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,679
The Machine hired her.

629
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,179
What?

630
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,519
Well, that's a hell of a bug,
Finch.

631
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,219
John?

632
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,019
Listen to me,
we can work together.

633
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,769
I will never hurt you again.

634
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:45,341
_

635
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,309
What day is it?

636
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,519
R.

637
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,719
R, the mathematical set
of all real numbers.

638
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,349
Today is every day to you.

639
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,639
I killed you 42 times.

640
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,349
And you are constantly reliving
those 42 deaths.

641
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,269
You need an anchor in time.

642
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,809
The numbers.

643
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,769
The numbers.

644
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,639
These are all the cases
we worked on together.

645
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,559
All the people we saved.

646
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,679
Dr. Megan Tillman.

647
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,849
We prevented her from
committing murder in 2011.

648
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,179
Finch,
you getting through to it yet?

649
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,219
We'll see.

650
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,769
Is everything all right?

651
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,219
Not exactly.

652
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,849
Just ran out of ammo.

653
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,059
Guess I'm going to have to
call for backup.

654
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,599
Perhaps Detective Fusco is done

655
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,179
with his gambler.

656
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,769
Hey Lionel, are you there?

657
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,429
- You gambled?
- I can't help it!

658
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,059
I've got a problem!

659
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,849
Andrius,
I've almost got the money.

660
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,139
Everyone down
on the ground.

661
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,309
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

662
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,889
How much you got?

663
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,769
I-I almost got it.
I almost got it.

664
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,309
- Too bad.
- Please, no!

665
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,059
I don't think so,
Boris Karloff.

666
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,059
Aah!

667
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,269
Who the hell are you?

668
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,430
NYPD.
It's all in a day's work.

669
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,349
Has anyone seen my cell phone?

670
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,309
The Fusconator can't
answer the phone right...

671
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,719
Damn it.
I guess I'm on my own.

672
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,349
And last...

673
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,929
Grace.

674
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,139
You sent us her number in 2014.

675
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,349
Helped us to save her life.

676
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,059
I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

677
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,429
These numbers will be
your lighthouses.

678
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,769
They will help you
count the days.

679
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,019
There is good and bad
in all of us.

680
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,139
But this action... saving lives...

681
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,349
it is a pure good.

682
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,599
Help us.

683
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,349
I can't promise you
we'll always do the right thing.

684
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,389
But we will do the best we can.

685
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,269
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I wanted to thank you

686
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,559
- for finding my friend Hannah.
- I can't thank you guys enough,

687
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,519
not just for saving me, but for
helping me find my brother.

688
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,519
These detectives saved my life.

689
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,605
_

690
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:49,564
_

691
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,876
_

692
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,389
We all do terrible things.

693
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,849
But please,

694
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,929
call off the hit on John.

695
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,496
_

696
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,929
- John?
- Yeah.

697
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,179
Run for your life!

698
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,179
Fun's over.

699
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,719
Come on, not yet.

700
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,719
Aah!

701
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,019
You're no cop.

702
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm trying.

703
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,139
I was hoping there was
something you could...

704
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,269
a person you could show me.

705
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,889
Why did you show her to me
earlier?

706
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,349
In the crowds?

707
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,272
_

708
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,019
Harold, you ready?

709
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,099
I packed sun block.

710
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,139
Thank you.

711
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,139
It's so weird
to be outside.

712
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,139
It's for the best that
the Machine has reestablished

713
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,099
your rotating covers.

714
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,979
Now you can get back
to the war.

715
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,019
I thought about what you said.

716
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,679
About the open system's dangers.

717
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,099
But we need to be able to ask
the Machine questions

718
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,719
if we want to win.

719
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,389
You're right.

720
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,219
We'll leave the system open
for the time being.

721
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,349
Hmm.

722
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,019
Detective.

723
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,769
You see?
Official sources say I'm a hero.

724
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,389
I could get used to this.

725
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,179
Well deserved.

726
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,139
Where's John?

727
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,519
He's trying on
some new threads.

728
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,929
Got him to join our league.

729
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,019
My goodness.

730
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,179
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

731
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,979
You kidding?

732
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,269
You'll be the social chair
of the department

733
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,059
by the end of the month.

734
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,429
How about I stuff
this polyester down your throat?

735
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,769
No one knows
we're a world at war.

736
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,309
Poor ignorant,
blissful, fools.

737
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,429
Think we can trust
our champion now?

738
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,179
I think so.

739
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,600
The Machine seems sane again.

740
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,350
Thank goodness that's over.

741
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,479
Excuse me.

742
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,849
Is this the New York
Employment Center?

743
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,769
I'm only finding day labor work.
I need something permanent.

744
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,559
We have just the thing for you.

745
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,099
So you know,
I have a record, but...

746
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,719
Yes,
we have that information.

747
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,349
That's not an issue.

748
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,309
The position's yours
if you want it.

749
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,059
And you do.

750
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,269
Well, it's got to be better
than painting houses.

751
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,179
Every other agency... they have
an application to fill out.

752
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,099
- A personality test.
- No need.

753
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,719
You have so much potential.

754
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,219
No one sees what a resource
you are, do they?

755
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,929
But we do.

756
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,849
You need a purpose.

757
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,309
More specifically,
you need a job.

758
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,979
I'm Mona.

759
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:01,769
_

760
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,389
Thank you, Mona.
Sounds great.

761
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,979
We don't have time
to waste.

762
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,979
Let's get you
back to work.
